The application is completely written in Python, HTML and SQL. It uses a database to write down all users and their news. Full access to the database can only be gathered by the administrator. HTML forms were being used to represent additional pages of adding and editing news and looking through all of them.

Static repository is used for storing images that come with the news. Creating multiple accounts and switching them isn't much trouble now. You may log out any time.
